# Review:

## Criteria overview:

- Does the web application use Django to serve static HTML content?
- Has the learner committed the project to a Git repository?
- Does the application connect the backend to a MySQL database?
- Are the menu and table booking APIs implemented?
- Is the application set up with user registration and authentication?
- Does the application contain unit tests?
- Can the API be tested with the Insomnia REST client?

### Routes:

- /auth/users
- /auth/token/login
- /auth/token/logout
- /auth/users/me
- /restaurant/
- /restaurant/booking/
- /restaurant/api-token-auth/
- /restaurant/
- /restaurant/menu
- /restaurant/menu/1

## Note:

### Please excuse the use of pymysql as the mysqlclient was not working on my machine.

### Please update your mysql credentials in the settings.py file.

# Thank you for your time and consideration!
